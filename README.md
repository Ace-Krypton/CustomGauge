## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the speedometer using the following controls:

- **Left Mouse Button:** Increase the separation value, which adjusts the perspective of the speedometer.
- **Right Mouse Button:** Decrease the separation value, adjusting the perspective in the opposite direction.
- **Shift + W:** Accelerate the speedometer needle movement. Holding down the Shift key while pressing W increases the speed of the needle.
- **Release W:** Start a timer that gradually reduces the speedometer value to zero.
